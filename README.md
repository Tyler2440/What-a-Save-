## Examples of non-obvious features:
- The "About the Project" tab at the top of the screen contains some useful information about what Rocket League is, what our project is, and some highlights of the data we collected.
- In the table, you are able to sort each header. For example, if you wanted to sort the list of games by date, you can click the "Game" table header.
- You are able to brush the "List of Games Played by ..." bubble chart, which will update the table accordingly.
- After clicking on a game in the table, scrolling down shows some statistics about the specific game you clicked, as well as two buttons to switch between statistical categories.
